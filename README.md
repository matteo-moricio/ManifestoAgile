#Description and history

Agile Software Development is a set of software development methods
in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams.
 It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
 The Manifesto for Agile Software Development, also known as the Agile Manifesto, was first proclaimed in 2001,
 six years after "Agile Methodology" was originally introduced by the preeminent software engineers
 of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Manifesto came out of the DSDM Consortium in 1994, 
 although its roots go back to the mid 1980s at DuPont and works by James Martin and James Kerr et al.
 
###Points
 
 1.Individuals and interactions
 2.Working software
 3.Customer collaboration
 4.Responding to change
 
####Principles

1.Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
2.Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
3.Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
4.Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5.Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6.Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7.Working software is the principal measure of progress
8.Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9.Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10.Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11.Self-organizing teams
12.Regular adaptation to changing circumstance
 
#####Philosophies
 Compared to traditional software engineering, agile software development mainly targets complex systems and projects with dynamic,
 non-deterministic and non-linear characteristics
 
1.Adaptive vs. predictive
2.Iterative vs. waterfall
3.Code vs. documentation

######Agile Methods

Popular agile software development methods and/or process frameworks include (but are not limited to):

1.Adaptive software development (ASD)
2.Agile modeling
3.Agile Unified Process (AUP)
4.Business analyst designer method (BADM)
5.Crystal Clear Methods
6.Disciplined agile delivery
7.Dynamic systems development method (DSDM)
8.Extreme programming (XP)
9.Feature-driven development (FDD)
10.Lean software development
11.Kanban (development)
12.Scrum
13.Scrumban
 
######Agile Practices
 
1.Acceptance test-driven development (ATDD)
2.Agile modeling
3.Backlogs (Product and Sprint)
4.Behavior-driven development (BDD)
5.Cross-functional team
6.Continuous integration (CI)
7.Domain-driven design (DDD)
8.Information radiators (scrum board, task board, visual management board, burndown chart)
9.Iterative and incremental development (IID)
10.Pair programming
11.Planning poker
12.Refactoring
13.Scrum events (sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review and retrospective)
14.Test-driven development (TDD)
15.Agile testing
16.Timeboxing
17.Use case
18.User story
19.Story-driven modeling
20.Retrospective
21.Velocity tracking
22.User Story Mapping

#######Applications outside software development

Under an Agile Business Management model, agile techniques, practices, principles and values are expressed across four domains.

1.Integrated customer engagement - to embed customers within any delivery process to share accountability for product/service delivery.
2.Facilitation-based management - adopting agile management models, like the role of Scrum Master, to facilitate the day-to-day operation of teams.
3.Agile work practices - adopting specific iterative and incremental work practices such as Scrum, Kanban, Test-Driven Development or Feature-Driven Development across all business functions (from Sales, Human Resources, Finance and Marketing).
4.An enabling organisational structure - with a focus on staff engagement, personal autonomy and outcomes based governance.
